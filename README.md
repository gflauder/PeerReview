## Attribution

This project is a fork of vphantom/pyriteview (https://github.com/vphantom/pyriteview) by Stéphane Lavergne (https://github.com/vphantom).

Article versioning hub for peer-reviewed publications.

This simple hub allows publication editors, single edition editors, article authors as well as third-party reviewers to come together to centralize the peer-reviewing workflow.  It was developed as a multilingual application in English and French, and 100% of linguistic content is in templates and dedicated "locale" files, so translating to new languages should be very easy.

### Why the name "Pyrite"?

"PyriteView" is a bilingual play on the words "Peer Review".  The [PyritePHP](https://github.com/vphantom/pyritephp) framework which it uses was originally created specifically for this application.

## Usage

After installation, just point your browser to your freshly configured server and log in using the account you just created.

**Power user login:** if you want to use your password instead of e-mail validation, just hit the _TAB_ key after typing your e-mail address, which will reveal the password field.


## Installation

### Download

To get the latest stable release, download and unpack a [release archive file](https://github.com/vphantom/pyriteview/releases).

### Requirements

* PHP 5.5 or later
* PHP extension modules: mbstring, mcrypt, pdo_sqlite, readline
* SQLite 3
* Typical Linux command line tools: make, wget, gzip
* A web server of course

### Initialization

Run `make init`.  This will automatically download and set up PHP's Composer package manager, then use it to download runtime dependencies locally.  Finally, it will create the database tables and the administrative user so you can log into your new installation.  You will be prompted on the command line for an e-mail address and password to use for that unrestricted account.  (**NOTE:** This prompt requires PHP's `readline`, so *it will not work on Windows*.)

You will also need to make sure that your web server or PHP process has read-write access to the `var/` directory where the database, logs and template cache are stored.

### Configuration

Edit `var/config.ini` to change any defaults as needed.

### Crontab

The same user as your web server (in order to have access to `var/`) should trigger the 'daily' event every day and 'hourly' every hour.  For example:

```crontab
7	4	*	*	*	/usr/bin/php /web/pyriteview/index.php --trigger daily
11	*	*	*	*	/usr/bin/php /web/pyriteview/index.php --trigger hourly
```

### Web Server Configuration

In order to produce clean, technology-agnostic URLs such as `http://www.yourdomain.com/articles/127`, you need to tell your web server to internally redirect requests for non-existent files to `/index.php`, which will look in `PATH_INFO` for details.  We also want to prevent access to private files.  You should also double-check that your php.ini allows file uploads with something like this:

```
upload_max_filesize = 8M
post_max_size = 25M
```

Here are sample configurations for major server software:

#### Apache

See the included `.htaccess` file.

#### Nginx

```
http {
	...
	client_max_body_size 34m;
	...
}

location ~ /(bin|locales|modules|node_modules|templates|var|vendor) {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}

location ~ \.php$ {
	# Usual FastCGI configuration
}

location / {
    index index.html index.htm index.php;
    try_files $uri $uri/ $uri/index.php /index.php?$args;
}
```


## Updating

While the structure of the framework isn't upgradeable since it consisted of a simple starting point for your own application, the bulk of the core components is safely packaged in NPM and Packagist (Composer).  Therefore, `make update` should provide all the bug fixes you'll need down the road.

## Acknowledgements

This application would not have been possible within a reasonable time frame without the help of the following:

### Server-side

* The PHP language
* The SQLite database engine
* The Sphido Events library to facilitate event-driven design
* The Twig PHP templating library
* The 100% PHP Gettext implementation

### Client-side

#### Frameworks

* jQuery 2 (there were performance issues with version 3)
* Twitter Bootstrap 3, including its gracious Glyphicon license

#### Utilities

* ParsleyJS to validate forms client-side
* Selectize to create rich, interactive form inputs
* Timeago to display human-readable timestamp descriptions

### Build Tools

* Browserify
* Clean-CSS
* Uglify-JS
