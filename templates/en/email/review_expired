<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
You had been invited to review the article
"{{ lib.format_article(article, true, true) }}"
to appear in {{ config.global.name }}.
</p>
<p>
As we have not received positive nor negative communication from you, this
invitation has now expired.
Please note that it would've been very useful for us to know explicitly of
your unavailability, so that we could've moved on sooner in our search of
available experts.
</p>
<p>
Thank you,
<br>{{ config.global.name }}
