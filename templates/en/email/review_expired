    <p>Greetings,</p>
    <p>
        You had been invited to review the article "{{ lib.format_article(article, true, true) }}" for {{ config.global.name }}.
        As we have not received a response from you, we must withdraw our invitation at this point.
        We hope that we can count on your collaboration in the future.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you,</p>
    <br>{{ config.global.name }}
